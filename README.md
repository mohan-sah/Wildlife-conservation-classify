Introduction

  Motivation: Increasing use of camera traps necessitates efficient wildlife image classification.
  •Challenges: Manual analysis is time-consuming, error-prone, and not scalable.
  •Solution: Deep learning automates classification, accelerates analysis, and enhances conservation efforts.
  •Scope: Developing a Hybrid Object Classification Model (HOCM) for robust species identification.
  •Objectives: Enhancing dataset quality, optimizing species detection, improving model performance, validating with log loss, and enabling real-world deployment.
